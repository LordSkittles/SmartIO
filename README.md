# SmartIO
A library aimed to make the FileIO of c++ easier and cleaner to use. My library allows the user to easily send data to Binary files and encrypt them if they so wish.

All Binary code is done by Neuroticcheeze with his permission. Found at https://github.com/Neuroticcheeze/Meridian-2D-Game-Engine.

All directory utils are wrappers around the dirent.h file by The Open Group.
